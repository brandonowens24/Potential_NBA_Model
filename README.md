# Potential_NBA_Model
With many csvs from websites like "basketball-reference.com", I wanted to make a simple neural network to see if I could better predict NBA game outcomes with the addition of injury statistics and referee statistics.

This activity helped me to get better with data wranging, pandas, feature engineering, and building neural networks using pytorch.

## Outcomes
* Null Model ~ 62.8% accurate
* Neural Network ~ 65% accurate

## Things to Be Improved
* Expanding training dataset (only ~1300 rows long).
* Neural Network Architecture (I'm a novice with building using pyTorch).
* Including real-time team data from the current season instead of using previous season's metrics.
* Including real-time player data from the current season instead of using previous season's metrics (for injury usage).
